# Anthro-Scheduler
Schedules node-cron tasks in human-like intervals. ðŸ˜‰

# Motivation
The initial usage for this was for a Twitter bot. Throughtout the day the bot was supposed to tweet at a specified interval. In order to make the scheduler seem human-like it could not be perfectly exact intervals. This scheduler allows you to set a minimum and maximum amount of minutes and seconds added for each interval, and the scheduler adds a random amount of time picked uniformly from the valid interval. 

# Usage

1. Clone and navigate into this project
```
git clone git@github.com:JimLynchCodes/Anthro-Scheduler.git
cd Anthro-Scheduler
```

2. Use node `v12.14.0`
```
nvm use
```

3. Install dependencies
```
npm i
```

4. Edit the `constants.js` file:

```
const constants = {
    INTERVAL_MIN_SECONDS: 0,  // min number of seconds added each interval
    INTERVAL_MAX_SECONDS: 55, // max number of seconds added each interval

    INTERVAL_MAX_MINUTES: 2,  // max number of minutes added each interval
    INTERVAL_MIN_MINUTES: 0,  // min number of minutes added each interval

    EARLIEST_TWEET_CUTOFF_HOUR: 8,  // earliest hour of the day a job will be scheduled
    LATEST_TWEET_CUTOFF_HOUR: 21,   // latest hour of the day a job will be scheduled
    
    COMMAND_TO_EXEUTE: 'cd /Users/jim/Git-Projects/Random-Tweeter && npm test',  // the shell command to be run each time the job is executed
}

module.exports = constants
```

5. Run the scheduler:
```
npm start
```
